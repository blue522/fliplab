      <p>
       <em>FlipLab is about using technology to make the classroom more interactive and relevant</em>.</p>


       <p>Khan Academy has sparked interest in “flip” their classroom, but much of this work has focused on the lower rungs of Bloom's Taxonomy: memorization, understanding and application. As “flipped classroom” interest increases, there is growing recognition that critical thinking skills, collaboration, and project-based learning are more important than ever.</p>

       <p><strong>The problem:</strong> we're still waiting for a comprehensive model of teaching that blends these two opportunities.</p>

       <p>That's why there is FlipLab - an opportunity for educators to actualize the best of these parallel teaching trends. FlipLab gathers educators to explore and share best teaching practice while leveraging recorded content. <a href="#mentors">Innovative teachers</a> serve as mentors through the process of discovery.</p>


       <img style="margin: 80px 80px; width: 549px" src="assets/img/flip_lab.png" alt="Flip-lab is pioneering teaching educators about the flipped classroom"/>

       <h2>What makes FlipLab different?</h2>
       <p>FlipLab is a 21st century professional development experience. The participants collaborate to create a roadmap for a great flipped classroom. Everything developed at FlipLab is shared with other teachers under a Creative Commons license.</p>

       <p>You will leave a FlipLab workshop with flipped lessons tailored for your classroom and ready to implement.  You'll pilot them in your classroom and work with peer coaches to debrief the results. Even better, you'll be part of a network of educators pushing the boundaries of educational best practice.</p>

<!-- What is a flipped classroom page
================================================== --><section id="flippedclassroom">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1>What is a “flipped classroom”?* <small>defined</small></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="row">

  <div class="span12 offset4">

     <p>At its core, a flipped classroom (also called flipped teaching, flipped instruction, vodcasting, educational video-on-demand) is a format for removing some of the lecture-based lessons from classrooms and giving students the ability to learn that content in their own time at their own pace. This is done through recording video-based lectures and posting them online for students to engage and respond to.</p>

     <p>There are several advantages to this model of teaching:</p>
     <ul class="span6">
     <li>Flipped teaching means that an educator doesn't need to guess at what speed to deliver content – with students watching lectures at home they can move at their own speed and review concepts as necessary.</li>
     <li>Without large portions of classroom time spent lecturing, educators can use that time to see students working through projects and assignments that would have previously been done in isolation at home:  break out sessions can occur spontaneously, students can work in mentor-based groupings, jigsaw opportunities, supplemental support, etc.</li></ul>

     <p>Jon Bergmann, Jerry Overmyer and Brett Wilie outline some other benefits in somewhat of a flip model manifesto, published at The Daily Riff:</p>
     <ul class="span6">
     <li>A means to INCREASE interaction and personalized contact time between students and teachers.</li>
     <li>An environment where students take responsibility for their own learning.</li>
     <li>A blending of direct instruction with constructivist learning.</li>
     <li>A classroom where students who are absent due to illness or extra-curricular activities such as athletics or field-trips, don't get left behind.</li>
     <li>A class where content is permanently archived for review or remediation.</li></ul>


     <h2>How is a flipped classroom different from other educational movements?</h2>
     <p>Flipped classroom isn't the first time that technology has been held up as a solution for the worldwide challenges that are occurring in education, and it won't be the last. However, the focus of flipped teaching is different from other examples in that the technology itself is simply a tool for flexible communication that allows educators to differentiate instruction to meet individual student needsand spend more time in the classroom focused on collaboration and higher-order thinking. The technology solutions are varied and don't rely on a single vendor to implement. Flipped teaching is a great example of using technology with intention.</p>

        <h2>FlipLab is looking for educators:</h2>

        <ul class="span6">
        <li>currently teaching grades 5-12;</li>
        <li>of math, English, science &amp; history who are interested in (or are experimenting with) a flipped format;</li>
        <li>comfortable experimenting with teaching techniques that don't yet have a clear step-by-step implementation roadmap.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Time Commitment</h2>
        <p><strong>FlipLab attendees should commit to attending all events - either in person or via video conference.</strong></p>

        <p>Educators should plan on attending at The Overlake School in Redmond, Washington from 9am-4pm on February 23-24. On April 21st, local educators will meet face-to-face again, while national attendee teams will gather to share information and then video conference in to the Overlake campus.</p>

        <p>Between those two sessions, all attendees will implement their flipped classroom lessons with a peer teacher in attendance – and observe at least one lesson led by a peer teacher.</p>

        <strong>Can't make it to Seattle? Bring FlipLab to your school!</strong></p>

        <p>Beginning September 2012, FlipLab will be available to come to your school. We will share the best practices documented by the innovators in cohort one, connect your faculty with FlipLab mentors working in different subject areas, and provide hands-on experience with the technology and tools you need to effectively flip your classroom.</p>

        <p>More importantly, we will help with what we call "the complete flip" - not just recording a lecture or giving kids more screen time, but using technology to make your class time more human, engaging, collaborative, and authentic. We'll work on concrete teaching strategies that change the way students work, and can even help you create original, custom content that your faculty will be ready to use the next day.</p>

        <p>Events can be customized to suit your needs – and meet your faculty where they are. Rates can be discussed once we understand what your school needs.</p>
